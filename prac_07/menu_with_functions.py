CP1401 - menu-driven program using functions - Guessing Game.

Things to note:
- Main contains the main things including the whole menu (never use a 'menu' function)
- Each menu choice is a section of the program implemented using a function
- Parameters are passed as needed:
    - play(low, high) - the play function needs to know both low and high, so these are passed in
    - set_limit(low) - this function only needs low
- Values are returned as needed:
    - play returns nothing because it doesn't need to
    - set_limit returns the new high (notice main uses this returned value and stores it in high)
- See how the number_of_games variable is NOT passed to play (or any function)?
  play does not need to know the number_of_games; that's NOT its job
  main updates number_of_games; this IS its job
  We _could_ pass number_of_games into play and have it update it, but that would be poor...
  Why?  - think of each function's job... SRP!
        - play is a function to play a single game; it should not know how many other games have been played
        - by not passing this, we simplify the play function (two parameters instead of three)
        - we could copy the play function to another program that just played once and never used number_of_games

Pseudocode:
Things to note:
- Functions (calls and headers) in pseudocode look almost identical to Python
- You MUST specify the parameters and returns
